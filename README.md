# Tech Stack
List the key technologies used to build the dashboard.

The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:
• 📊 Power BI Desktop – Main data visualization platform used for report creation.
• 📂 Power Query – Data transformation and cleaning layer for reshaping and preparing the data.
• 🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Used for calculated measures, dynamic visuals, and conditional logic.
• 📝 Data Modeling – Relationships established among tables.
• 📁 File Format – .pbix for development and .png for dashboard previews.

# Data Structure and Data Modeling
I collected the dataset from Code Basics’ website. The data includes two types of tables:

Dimension table – contains descriptive information about the data.

Fact table – contains the main measurements or metrics.

dim_date
dim_hotels
dim_rooms
fact_aggregated_bookings
fact_bookings
